## Purpose 

I decided to make this repo to make it easier for anyone interested in quickly ramping-up a Laravel-Vue-Typescript 
project. 

I tried my best to be very descriptive in each commit text, so if you want to learn more about the set-up process, read the commit messages. 

## What does it offer?

- [x] Laravel 5.8

- [x] Typescript support

- [x] Typescript Vue Components

- [x] Typescript Jest with Vue Test Utils

## Important commands 

`yarn test`: Runs all Vue Tests

`yarn watch`: Watch mode
